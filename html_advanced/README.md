Advanced HTML involves using semantic elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>` to create well-structured, accessible web pages, along with powerful features such as forms with built-in validation, multimedia embedding through `<video>` and `<audio>`, and custom `data-*` attributes for dynamic content.
It also includes integration with APIs, use of `<canvas>` for graphics, and responsive design techniques for mobile-friendly layouts. These advanced tools make HTML more interactive, professional, and ready for modern web development.
