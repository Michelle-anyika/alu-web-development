Advanced CSS involves techniques that go beyond basic styling, including the use of Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts, media queries for adapting designs to different screen sizes, and CSS variables for reusability.
It also includes animations, transitions, pseudo-classes (like :hover, :nth-child) for interactivity, and custom fonts with @font-face.
Mastering advanced CSS allows you to create clean, scalable, and visually engaging websites that work across all devices.
